== Escaping reserved characters

The curly braces characters `{}` and the single quote `'` are reserved characters
and need to be escaped.

Escaping is done by enclosing the characters by single quotes,
e.g. `These are curly braces: '{ }'` results in `These are curly braces: { }`

An exception is the single quote. It is escaped using a double singe quote,
e.g.: `This isn''t a double quote!` result in `This isn't a double quote!`

Recommendation: Use the real apostrophe (single quote) character `â€™` (U+2019) for human-readable text,
and use the ASCII apostrophe `'` (U+0027) only in program syntax, like quoting.
